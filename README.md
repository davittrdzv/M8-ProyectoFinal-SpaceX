# SpaceX Explorer Website — Final Project (Module 8, DEV.F)

🌎 Live site: PENDING

Built as the final project for the Web Development Program (Module 8) at DEV.F.

This is a front-end-focused single-page application (SPA) built with `React` and `Vite`. It showcases data from the official SpaceX public API and allows user authentication via a mock backend (JSON Server + JWT) provided by DEV.F. The application features protected routes, role-based rendering, and reusable visual components, all styled with Bootstrap.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: `React`, `Vite`, `React Router DOM`, `Bootstrap 5`
- **State & Forms**: React Hooks, Context API, custom hooks
- **Routing & Navigation**:
    - Centralized route definition with a `RoutesIndex` file
    - Protected routes using wrapper components
    - Role-based and conditional rendering
- **API & Auth**:
    - SpaceX API (public, open-source)
    - Mock backend with `JSON Server + JWT` (external, not built by me)
- **Utilities**:
    - Axios for HTTP requests
    - Utility helpers for date formatting, fallback handling, etc.
    - Reusable UI cards for launches, rockets, and Starlink satellites

## 🔐 User Access

You can log in using one of the following pre-registered accounts:

- 👤 **Regular User**
    - Email: `drstrange@marvel.com`
    - Password: `multiverso`

- 🛠️ **Admin User**

    - Password: `superman`

Or you can create your own account via the **Sign Up** page.

>⚠️ This mock backend is hosted on a free tier (Render), so data will reset after periods of inactivity.
